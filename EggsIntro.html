	<p class = "bodies">The first known use of eggs is from 3200 BC when birds were domesticated in East India, though few of these eggs were eaten before hatching. Records show that eggs were used in China and Egypt as early as 1400 BC. These eggs were often from either chickens or ostriches. In Greece, quail eggs were very popular. The Romans often used eggs as appetizers. There is evidence of eggs in America before Columbus, but the ones used today were brought over during those expeditions</p>
